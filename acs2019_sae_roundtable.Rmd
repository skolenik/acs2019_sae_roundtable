In many social, behavioral or health studies, there may be interest in obtaining estimates for small subgroups of population

- National studies: estimates may be desired for
  
    * states
    * counties
    * school districts
    * metro areas 

- Statewide studies: estimates for counties, cities, health service areas
- City-wide studies: estimates for neighborhoods
- Establishment sureys: detailed industry by size by region classifications

Given the low sample sizes for small areas (sometimes _n_ = double digits,
sometimes _n_ = single digits, sometimes _n_ = 0), can any reasonable
estimates be obtained? If yes, can any reasonable measures of precision be
attached to these estimates?
Since survey means/proportions may not be available, or are of insufficient accuracy, 
demographic or statistical models have to be used, and weaved into complex survey estimation.

## Concepts

_Small area_: a subpopulation, a domain, a subset of the overall population of a survey that may 
have insufficient data / number of observations to support (accurate) statistical inference.

_Direct estimate_: an estimate for a small area based only on the survey data in that small area, 
e.g. weighted mean

_Synthetic estimate_: an estimate for a small area that is based solely on a statistical model,
typically a regression or a generealized linear model.

_Composite estimate_: an estimate that combines both a direct estimate and a synthetic estimate.

## Methodologies

### Ratio estimation

Groupwise ratio estimator applies means or proportions of the outcome in a population group 
to the population of the small area of interest.

1. Split large sample into groups (e.g., age-gender-education), _g_ = 1; ... ;_G_
2. Estimate the nationwide mean outcome in each group ($j$ enumerates survey observations):
$$
\bar y_g = \frac{\sum_{j \in g} y_j w_j }{\sum_{j \in g}w_j} 
$$
where $y_j$ is the outcome observation for unit $j$, and $g$ is the group variable.

3. Apply the small area $i$ group counts/proportions as weights to obtain the SAE estimate:
$$
\hat y_i = \frac{\sum_g \bar y_g N_{ig}}{\sum_g N_{ig}} 
$$
where $N_{ig}$ is the population count of group $g$ in area $i$. (Viewed differently,
if $W_{ig} = N_{ig}/N_i,N_i = \sum_g N_{ig}$ is the population proportion of group $g$ in area $i$,
$\hat y_i = \sum_g W_{ig} \hat y_g$.)

This produces a synthetic estimate, i.e., the one that is based only on the aggregate data.
The implicit statistical model is that the outcome is constant within cells defined by the groups.

_Data requirements_: 

- Survey data:

    + Outcome of interest _y_ 
    + Identifiers of the groups _g_

- Population data:  

    + Identifiers of the small areas
    + Population counts in categories of _g_ for each area _i_

### Weighting/calibration

In this method, the estimates are obtained by (re-)weighting the sample data to the socio-demographic
characteristics of the area of interest. Estimates can be expected to be biased unless the weighting variables
fully account for both sample selection and outcome variation. With only single weighting variable, the method
becomes the group-wise ratio estimator described above.

Both groupwise ratio estimation and reweighting approach produce synthetic estimates only,
and hence can produce estimates that are biased and not design-consistent (i.e., as the sample sizes
of areas increase, the estimates may not converge to their population counterparts).

A strengthed version of the method is due to 
([Lehtonen and Veijanen (2019)](http://isi-iass.org/home/wp-content/uploads/Survey_Statistician_January_2019.pdf)).
In their approach, they fit a model (based on the survey data) to the outcome using predictors available 
for the whole population (assuming availability of the population register), obtain predictions,
calibrate the sample to predictions (i.e. reweight the sample so that the weighted sample total of predictions
is equal to the population total of predictions), and obtain calibrated estimates based on the sample
with the actual outcomes.

_Data requirements_: 

- Survey data:

    + Outcome of interest _y_ 
    + Identifiers of the small areas
    + Weighting variables _x_

- Population data:  

    + Identifiers of the small areas
    + Population counts in categories of _x_

### Area models

Area SAE models fit regression models to the area-level direct estimates, thus smoothing them.
Denote the true value in area $i$ as $\theta_i$. Then 
the direct estimates for areas $i$,
$$
\bar y_i = \frac{\sum_{j \in i} w_i y_i}{\sum_{j \in i} w_i y_i}
$$
can be thought of the true value plus the _sampling_ error:
$$
\hat y_i = \theta_i + e_i
$$
where the magnitude of the error $e_i$ can be obtained through the standard survey estimation
procedures, $\mathbb{V}_d[e_i] = \psi_i$, where subscript $d$ denotes variances with respect 
to the sampling Design and e.g. will be smaller in the areas that have larger sample sizes.

Auxiliary information on area characteristics $x_i$ is brought in through a regression model of the form
$$
\theta_i = x_i \beta + v_i
$$
where $v_i$ is the _model_ error that satifies the standard regression modeling assumptions
(e.g., that $v_i$ are independent in different areas, and that their variance is constant, 
$\mathbb{V}_m[v_i]=\sigma_v^2$, where the subscript $m$ denots variance in the statistical Model).
Oftentimes, a transformation is applied to $\hat y_i$. E.g. when $y_i \equiv p_i$ is a proportion,
the variance of the estimate is $p_i(1-p_i)$ divided by the (effective) sample size, i.e., not constant.
The arcsine transformation $\arcsin \sqrt{p_i}$ makes the variance approximately constant,
at the expense of making the model more complicated.

Once the regression model parameters $\beta$ are estimated, the _synthetic_ estimates
are obtained as $x_i \hat\beta$. The _composite_ estimates can now be obtained as
$$
\tilde\theta_i = \gamma_i \bar y_i + (1-\gamma_i) x_i \beta
$$
where $\gamma_i$ is the compositing factor, which is the weight of the direct estimate
in the final estimate:
$$
\gamma_i = \frac{\sigma_v^2}{\psi_i + \sigma_v^2}
$$
For areas with relatively large sample sizes, $\gamma_i$ should be expected
to be close to 1 (because the variance of the direct estimates $\psi_i$ is relatively small), 
while for areas with small sample sizes, close to 0, and equal to 0 for 
areas that have zero sample size / not represented in the sample.

Composite area models are design-consistent: as area sample sizes increase, the sampling variances
$\psi_i$ go down, the compositing factors $\gamma_i$ increase to 1, and the properties of 
the composite estimates resemble those of the direct estimates $\bar y_i$.

_Data requirements_: 

- Survey data:

    + Outcome of interest _y_ 
    + Identifiers of the small areas
    + Method to estimate sampling variances $\psi_i$

- Population data:  

    + Area-level predictors
    + Identifiers of the small areas

### Unit models

Unit SAE models fit regression or generalized linear models to the outcomes observed at the person level:

$$
y_{ij} = x_{ij}\beta + v_i + e_{ij}
$$
where $x_{ij}$ are person-level predictors (which could include area-level predictors that are constant
for all individuals within an area), $v_i$ are area-level random effects, and $e_{ij}$ are person-level
model errors. Just like for area models, one can obtain _synthetic_ estimates based on the model only,
$\hat y_i = \bar X_i \hat\beta + \hat v_i$, where the area means $X_i$ are the means of predictor variables
at the area level (e.g., based on population census or registers), and composite estimates 
$$
\tilde \theta_i = \bar X_i \hat\beta + \tilde v_i, \quad \tilde v_i = \gamma_i (\bar y_i - \bar x_i \hat \beta)
$$
where the random area effects are based on the _sample_ means of the outcomes $y_i$ and predictors $x_i$,
and the compositing factor is
$$
\gamma_i = \frac{\sigma_v^2}{\sigma_v^2 + \sigma_e^2/n_i}
$$
To show how this synthetic estimator combines direct and synthetic estimates, it can be written as
$$
\tilde \theta_i =\gamma_i \bigl[ \bar y_i + (\bar X_i - \bar x_i) \hat \beta  \bigr] 
 + (1-\gamma_i) \bar X_i \hat\beta
$$


_Data requirements_: 
- Survey data:

    + Outcome of interest _y_ 
    + Predictors _x_ (e.g., demographic variables)
    + Identifiers of the small areas
    + Procedures to fit multilevel/mixed models and estimate $\sigma_v^2$, $\sigma_e^2$.

- Population data:  

    + The same predictor variables _x_ for the small area as those used in the SAE model in the large data set
      **for everybody in the population**
    + Identifiers of the small areas

Both unit-level (i.e., person level) and area-level (e.g., county level) predictors are typically used.

In some approaches (e.g., [Pierannunzi et. al. 2016](https://www.cdc.gov/pcd/issues/2016/15_0480.htm)),
instead of using the full population data, a high quality large sample size survey is used: in their example,
the model is fitted to BRFSS data while the predictions are obtained on the ACS data. Standard error computations
should account for the sampling error in the second survey, as well.

### Multilevel regression with post-stratification

This method (MRP) originated in political science 
([Park, Gelman and Bafumi 2004](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/parkgelmanbafumi.pdf)),
and has also become popular in health sciences. In this method, a multilevel/mixed model 
of the following structure is fit to **unweighted** survey data:

- random effects are specified at the area level;
- the unit-level (demographic) predictors are only those for which fully interacted population counts
(census tables) are available;
- area level predictors can, but do not have to, be used

Once that model is fit, predictions are obtained that include integration over random effects:
empirical Bayes for frequentist/REML/ML mixed modeling approach, posterior draws in Bayesian/MCMC approach.
These predictions are finally post-stratified by the population counts to the small area estimates of interest.

MRP thus combines ideas of multilevel unit models with the (re)weighting/groupwise estimation approach.

A possible simplification of the model is to forgo the multilevel modeling, and/or empirical Bayes prediction of random effects.

Popularity of the MRP model is partially explained by the lack of functionality in R to fit 
mixed models with weighted data. Recently, a new package `WeMix` appeared that offers this functionality
(see [the latest version on CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=WeMix)). Also, this is one of the few
Bayesian models that make some sense with weighted survey data, in that it offers a way to aggregate 
(unweighted) Bayesian model predictions to the population.
